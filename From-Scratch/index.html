        5 Reasons Why You Should Attend BYU
    </div>

    <div class="mainbodybox">
        <h3><a id="reason1">1. We have many temples nearby</a></h3>
        <p>One of the best parts about BYU is its faith-based teaching and environment, espousing the beliefs and doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Among the most important aspects of the Church is our focus on temples, and there is no place in the world with better access to a temple than here in Provo, Utah. Below you'll see a Tableau graphic representing temples around the world, and you'll find that Provo has an extremely strong concentration. If you're looking for temples, there's no better place to be!</p>

        <h3><a id="reason2">2. The people here are great!</a></h3>
        <p>If there's one thing that can be said for BYU, it's that the people here are among the nicest you'll ever meet. Thanks in large part to upholding LDS standards, people are always willing to lend a helping hand when you're in need. Speaking from personal experience, I've accidentally left important items like my bag or wallet in various places and returned to find that nobody had taken them. The moral standards here are simply next-level, and you won't find them just about anywhere else.</p>
        <p>Even aside from the kindness and respect, the social life here is great! From multiple D1 sports teams to high quality arts programs, there's always something fun going on on-campus for you to do. Even if you don't want to stay on campus more than you have to, there are numerous options in and around Provo/Orem for you and your friends to enjoy! Ask just about anyone here: BYU is the place to be to make friends and memories that'll last a lifetime.</p>

Offering 178 undergraduate majors and a number of minors, there really is something here for everyone. What's more is that while many universities have "problem areas" or only do a couple things well, BYU offers quality education across the board, including (but not limited to) the following statistics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>#36 in Best Business Schools (#6 in Accounting)</li>
            <li>#23 in Best Law Schools</li>
            <li>#15 in Animation</li>
            <li>#49 in Public Affairs</li>
            <li>#6 in Information Technology</li>
            <li>#15 in Education</li>
            <li>And many more!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No matter what you want to study, or what career you want to pursue, BYU has a place for you. As a (very important) bonus, you'll also get access to a tightly-knit, expansive alumni network spanning tons of industries and disciplines. As far as options for colleges go career-wise, it's hard to beat BYU.</p>
        <h3><a id="reason5">5. Our sports teams are legendary</a></h3>
        <p>Across the history of professional and collegiate sports, you'll find BYU alumni and influence everywhere. This is no better exemplified than in football, where such players and coaches as Mike Leach, Andy Reid, Steve Young, Lavell Edwards, and many more shaped the game as we know it today. Recently, after many years of independence from college conferences, BYU is now set to join the Big-12 next year, matching up against elite competition like TCU, UT, and OU.
